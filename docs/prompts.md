# Test Prompts for ProcessXY

## Simple Prompts

### 1. Employee Onboarding

I need a simple onboarding flow for new employees. It should start when HR receives the signed offer letter, then IT sets up their accounts and equipment, followed by their manager scheduling orientation. After orientation is complete, they're officially onboarded.

### 2. Bug Report Triage

Create a process for handling incoming bug reports. Someone submits a bug, then a developer reviews it to determine if it's valid. If it's not a real bug, we close it with a note. If it is valid, we add it to the sprint backlog and assign a developer.

### 3. Expense Reimbursement

We need an expense reimbursement workflow. An employee submits their expense report with receipts. Their direct manager reviews it first - if the amount is under $500, the manager can approve it directly and it goes to finance for payment. But if it's $500 or more, it needs additional approval from the department head before going to finance. If anyone rejects it at any stage, it goes back to the employee with feedback so they can revise and resubmit.

### 4. Content Publishing Pipeline

Map out our content publishing process. A writer drafts an article and submits it for review. The editor checks it - they might approve it, request revisions, or reject it entirely. If revisions are needed, it goes back to the writer who updates it and resubmits. Once approved by the editor, it goes to the legal team for compliance review. Legal can also request changes or approve it. After legal approval, the content team schedules and publishes it.

### 5. Loan Application Processing

I want to visualize our loan application process. When a customer applies, we first do an initial eligibility check based on basic criteria. If they don't meet minimum requirements, we send a rejection letter. If they pass, we pull their credit report and a loan officer reviews everything.

The loan officer decides if we need additional documentation - if so, we request it from the customer and wait for them to provide it, then the officer reviews again. Once documentation is complete, the officer makes a preliminary decision.

For small loans under $50k, the officer can approve directly. For larger amounts, it goes to a credit committee for review. The committee might approve, deny, or approve with modified terms. Whatever the final decision, we notify the customer. If approved, we generate loan documents for signing and then fund the loan.
